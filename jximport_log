WARNING

Traditional Jenkins masters are being deprecated and removed from all new Jenkins X releases starting on April 20, 2020.
We strongly recommend using the default Tekton-based configuration instead for all Jenkins X activity going forward. We do not recommend using the Jenkins X workflow based around Jenkins masters.

For more information: https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/11/tekton/
